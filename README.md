# Introduction

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yarasi Ashokvardhana Reddy

After my graduation, I wanted to prepare for bank exams. So I joined Mahindra Banking Institute in Hyderabad, I took 8 months of coaching for bank exams. After that, I came to my nearest city to prepare for exams. While I was preparing for banking exams, I also worked in a medical shop for a few years and a few months with Zomato.

Before joining Masai School, I was working as an amazon delivery executive. Then a few of my friends suggested me to learn software Programming languages. But I did not know where to learn and how to learn. Then I found Masai School on Youtube and I enrolled for the Full Stack Web Development course.

At Masai School, I learnt technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, MERN Stackvalong with Data Structures and Algorithms. soft skills and Problem-Solving skills and used them in the two projects that I was a part of, one of which was clone of Juicy Chemistry and the other was Bodywise.
